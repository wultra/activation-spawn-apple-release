# Usage

The `WultraActivationSpawn` library is proprietary and therefore the rest of the documentation is not available for the public. If you have granted access to Wultra's artifactory, then use the following commands to obtain full documentation:

```
wget https://wultra.jfrog.io/artifactory/activation-spawn-apple-release/WultraActivationSpawn-0.0.2.documentation.zip
unzip WultraActivationSpawn-0.0.2.documentation.zip -d Documentation
```
